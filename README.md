# crux
A simple hex editor implemented in both C and Rust to learn both languages :)

# agenda
The C implementation is complete and works nicely. The Rust one is my big milestone. I've been in need of a simple hex editor so I'm hoping this is one I can use a fair amount (probably not LOL).

# usage
Run the binary against any given file and follow instructions :))))))))))))))
